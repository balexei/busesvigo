Buses Vigo is an Android app designed for residents and frequent users of the public transport
system in Vigo who want a quick way to check the next buses arriving at a particular bus stop.
This app doesn't provide navigation or route suggestions, it is targeted to users familiar with the
city who simply need real-time bus arrival information at specific stops.
